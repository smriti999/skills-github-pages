# My First Blog Post 🎉

Today I created my first blog post using GitHub Pages.

I learned how to:
- Create a new file inside the _posts folder
- Use the correct date format
- Add frontmatter using YAML
- Write content in Markdown

This is just the beginning of my blogging journey. I’m excited to keep learning and sharing more!

Stay tuned for more updates ...
